Hello! I am Bo Chen, a final-year Ph.D. student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Florida. I am under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Hale and am a member of [the Control, Optimization, and Robotics Engineering (CORE) Lab](https://corelab.mae.ufl.edu/). Prior to my Ph.D. study, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree in 2017 with a major in Aerospace Engineering from Northwestern Polytechnical University in China. I also obtained my Master of Science degree, specializing in Aerospace Engineering, from the University of Florida in 2019.
